# trotter-suzuki
Simulation of wavefunction
This program will simulate the propagation of 2-d wavefunction through a potential barrier. Trotter-suzuki algortihm is used to simulate the result of time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The program will plot the propagation of wavefunction through real space.
